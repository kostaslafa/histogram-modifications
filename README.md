## General info
This project is the result of an assignment on Course 'Digital Image Processing' when I was an undergraduate student.
It includes nine MATLAB files, 8 of which are functions and the last one is a script for presenting the results.

The functions are operating on grayscale images but the input can be either an RGB or a grayscale image.
I have included RGB to grayscale conversion if the input is an RGB image.

Note: 
1. The files includes comments for easy reading but you can also find a brief report for each file below.
2. I have uploaded a jpg image 'Lenna.jpg'. I do not own the copyrights of this image and I only uploaded it for the purpose of presenting this project.

## myimhist
This function creates the histogram of an image. Not by using the MATLAB command.

## myhisteq
This function performs histogram equalization of an image. Not by using the MATLAB command.

## neg
This function creates the negative of an image.

## metdyn
This function performs the raise to power operation.

## logmet
This function performs the log transformation on images.

## expmet
This function performs the exponential transformation on images.

## gaussmet
This function performs a transformation based on Gaussian error functions.

## incc
This function increases the contrast of an image.

## histogram
The histogram.m file is a script where the results are presenting.
